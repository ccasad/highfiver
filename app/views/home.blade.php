          <h4>Deliverables</h4>
          <p>
            There were two required deliverables for this programming challenge. The first 
            is the <a href="{{ $baseurl }}players">High Fiver</a> app, which you can get to by clicking on the green button above. The 
            app was built in PHP using the Laravel MVC Framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second requirement is a description of my strategy for system testing, which is below in the next section.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although not explicitly defined as a requirement I have my code available for <a href="https://github.com/ccasad/highfiver/archive/master.zip">download on GitHub</a>.
          </p>

          <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
          <p>
            VNN wants to keep track of the leader board of top basketball players in Indiana. VNN has 
            asked you to create a web app called “High Fiver” that dynamically shows users the top five 
            scorers in Indiana Boys Basketball, and gives users the ability to see game-by-game scoring 
            information about any of those players in a very simple format.
          </p>

          <h4>User Stories</h4>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Users should dynamically see the top 5 players in Indiana basketball, ranked based on 
                their scoring average. See <a href="http://www.varvee.com/team/individual_leaderboard/54/27/" target="_blank">http://www.varvee.com/team/individual_leaderboard/54/27/</a>
              </li>
              <li>
                When a user clicks on a player, she should see a breakdown of that player's statistics 
                by game throughout the season. These stats include only: Points, team points, W/L
              </li>
              <li>
                Users should see a graph that shows how many points the player has scored each 
                game, plotted against how many points their team has scored in the same game.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <h4>Functional Requirements</h4>
          <p>All info must be screen scraped dynamically from Varvee for every page load on High Fiver.</p>

          <h4>Non-Functional Requirements</h4>
          <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Unit tests should be written for Varvee.com parsing logic when getting info
            </li>
            <li>
              Application must be created in a PHP web framework or Ruby on Rails
            </li>
          </ol>
          </p>
